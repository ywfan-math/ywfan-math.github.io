        <ul>
            
            <li>
                (9/4) I am truly sorry that I didn't notice until yesterday that the date of our first in-class midterm,
                October 1st, is an important religious holiday.
                We will do makeup exam in this case.
                If you can't attend the first midterm because of religious reasons,
                please send me an email as soon as possible so that we can make a proper arrangement.
                We will not do makeup exam for the second midterm and the final.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                (9/3) HW2 has been updated (one problem was removed).
                Some problems require proofs or justifications. Start early!

            <li>
                (9/2) I will be out of town from Friday, September 6th to Wednesday, September 11th, and
                from Thursday, September 12th afternoon to Monday, September 16th. So my office hours on
                September 10th and 11th are cancelled. Please feel free to reach me by email!

        <h3>Course Information</h3>
        
        <b>Topics:</b> The real number system. Sequences, limits, and continuous functions in R.
        The concept of a metric space. Uniform convergence, interchange of limit operations. Infinite series.
        Mean value theorem and applications. The Riemann integral.
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Grading:</b> Homework 20%, First Midterm 20%, Second Midterm 20%, Final 40%.<br>
        <b>There will be no makeup exams.</b> However,
        the lowest score of the two midterms will be replaced by the final exam score if this increases
        your total score. So you can miss one midterm without too much damage.
        On the other hand, missing both midterms or missing the final will seriously harm your grade.
        <b>Please check the dates now to make sure that you have no unavoidable conflicts!</b>

        <h3>Course Materials</h3>
        <b>Textbook:</b> Ross, <i>Elementary Analysis: The Theory of Calculus</i> (Second Edition).<br>
        You can download a copy of this book
        <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4614-6271-2">here</a>.
        
        <hr>
        
        <h3>Homework</h3>
        
        Homework consists of reading and problems sets. There will be reading assigned for each lecture.
        You should come to the class having read the assigned sections of the textbook.
        <br>
        
        Problem sets will be assigned weekly. Assignments will be posted no later than midnight on Tuesday
        and will be due at the beginning of the class on the following Tuesday.
        You have to staple your work if it is more than a page.
        Homework will be graded based on completion.
        The lowest homework grade will be dropped.
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Late homework policy:</b> As a rule late homework will not be accepted under any circumstances.
        If you are late to class on Tuesday, your homework is late and and will not be graded.
        If you have a medical circumstance
        that prevents you from turning in homework, you will need a doctor's note to receive an extension. Furthermore,
        a note that merely says “Student visited today” is not very helpful; it’s better to have a note that says something
        like “Student may be unable to complete assignments for the next N days.” This will help me decide what length of
        extension is appropriate.
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Collaboration:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the assignments. In your solutions, you should
        acknowledge the students with whom you worked, and you should write your solutions on your own. For any solution
        you submit, you should understand it well enough that you can explain it to someone else and answer questions
        about it. If you find yourself writing down things that you can’t explain, you should go back and think more about
        the problem. Otherwise you’re doing yourself a disservice, and you might suffer more when it comes time to take
        the midterms/exam.

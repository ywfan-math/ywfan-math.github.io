        <h3>Birational geometry and Derived categories related</h3>
        
        <b>Mirror of Atiyah flop in symplectic geometry and stability conditions
            (with Hansol Hong, Siu-Cheong Lau and Shing-Tung Yau)</b><br>
        Adv. Theor. Math. Phys., 2018. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02942">arXiv:1706.02942</a>)<br>
        <p style="margin-left:40px">
        We study the mirror operation of the Atiyah flop in symplectic geometry.
        We formulate the operation for a symplectic manifold with a Lagrangian fibration.
        Furthermore we construct geometric stability conditions on the derived Fukaya category of the deformed conifold
        and study the action of the mirror Atiyah flop on these stability conditions.<br>

        <b>New rational cubic fourfolds arising from Cremona transformations
            (with Kuan-Wen Lai)</b><br>
        To appear soon. <br>
        <p style="margin-left:40px">
            It is conjectured that two cubic fourfolds are birational if their associated K3 categories are equivalent.
            We prove this conjecture for very general cubic fourfolds of discriminant 20,
            where the birational maps are produced via the Cremona transformation defined by the Veronese surface.
            Using these birational maps, we find new rational cubic fourfolds.

        <h3>Categorical dynamical systems</h3>
        
        <b>On pseudo-Anosov autoequivalences
            (with Simion Filip, Fabian Haiden, Ludmil Katzarkov and Yijia Liu)</b><br>
        Submitted. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12350">arXiv:1910.12350</a>)<br>
        <p style="margin-left:40px">
            We show that any autoequivalence on a triangulated category induces a canonical filtration of
            invariant thick triangulated subcategories.
            Then we give a new (more general) definition of pseudo-Anosov autoequivalences and provide
            several examples on 3-Calabi-Yau categories, including the derived categories of quintic threefolds.
            This work is motivated by the connections between Teichm&uuml;ller theory and Bridgeland stability conditions.

        <b>Entropy of an autoequivalence on Calabi-Yau manifolds</b><br>
        Math. Res. Lett., 2018. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06957">arXiv:1704.06957</a>)<br>
        <p style="margin-left:40px">
        We construct the first counterexamples of a conjecture on categorical entropy by Kikuta and Takahashi.
        The result shows that because of the existence of `hidden symmetries' on Calabi-Yau manifolds
        (autoequivalences that are not generated by tensoring line bundles, automorphisms, and shiftings),
        the autoequivalences on the derived categories contain much richer dynamical information than the
        automorphisms on Calabi-Yau manifolds.

        <b>On entropy of P-twists</b><br>
        Submitted. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10485">arXiv:1801.10485</a>)<br>
        <p style="margin-left:40px">
        P-twists are the mirror of Dehn twists along Lagrangian complex projective space under mirror symmetry.
        We compute the categorical entropy of autoequivalences given by P-twists,
        and show that these autoequivalences satisfy a Gromov-Yomdin type conjecture.

        <h3>Bridgeland stability conditions and Geometry</h3>
        
        <b>On the geometric realization of stable objects in Calabi-Yau categories
            (with Man-Wai Cheung and Yu-Shen Lin)</b><br>
        To appear soon. <br>
        <p style="margin-left:40px">
            We show that there is a foliation on the space of Bridgeland stability conditions on the
            3-Calabi-Yau category associated to A2-quiver, such that each leaf is the base of certain
            Lefschetz fibration, where stable objects correspond to special Lagrangian Lefschetz thimbles, and
            central charges are the integration of the holomorphic top form on the total space.

        <b>Weil-Petersson geometry on the space of Bridgeland stability conditions
            (with Atsushi Kanazawa and Shing-Tung Yau)</b><br>
        Accepted to Comm. Anal. Geom. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02161">arXiv:1708.02161</a>)<br>
        <p style="margin-left:40px">
        We define a Weil-Petersson potential function on the space of Bridgeland stability conditions,
        with the hope of further understand the stringy K&auml;hler moduli space of Calabi-Yau manifolds.
        We show that the induced Weil-Petersson metric coincides with the Bergman metric in some two-dimensional cases.

        <b>Systolic inequalities for K3 surfaces via stability conditions</b><br>
        Submitted. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09684">arXiv:1803.09684</a>)
        (<a href="http://scgp.stonybrook.edu/video_portal/video.php?id=3940">video</a>)<br>
        <p style="margin-left:40px">
            We introduce the notions of categorical systoles and categorical volumes of Bridgeland stability conditions
            on triangulated categories. We prove a systolic inequality for any complex projective K3 surface,
            which is an algebro-geometric generalization of Loewner's torus systolic inequality.
            We also discuss applications of this inequality in symplectic geometry.

        <b>Contractibility of space of stability conditions on the projective plane via global dimension function
            (with Chunyi Li, Wanmin Liu and Yu Qiu)</b><br>
        (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11984">arXiv:2001.11984</a>)
        <p style="margin-left:40px">
            We give an alternate proof of the contractibility of the space of Bridgeland stability conditions on
            the derived category of projective plane by examine the global dimension function introduced by Ikeda-Qiu.
            Furthermore, we show that most of the stability conditions on local projective plane
            can be induced from stability conditions on projective plane by Ikeda-Qiu's inducing theorem.

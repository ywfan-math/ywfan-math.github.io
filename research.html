        <b>Mirror of Atiyah flop in symplectic geometry and stability conditions
            (with Hansol Hong, Siu-Cheong Lau and Shing-Tung Yau)</b><br>
        Adv. Theor. Math. Phys., 2018. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02942">arXiv:1706.02942</a>)<br>

        We study the mirror operation of the Atiyah flop in symplectic geometry.
        We formulate the operation for a symplectic manifold with a Lagrangian fibration.
        Furthermore we construct geometric stability conditions on the derived Fukaya category of the deformed conifold
        and study the action of the mirror Atiyah flop on these stability conditions.<br>

        <b>Weil-Petersson geometry on the space of Bridgeland stability conditions
            (with Atsushi Kanazawa and Shing-Tung Yau)</b><br>
        Accepted to Comm. Anal. Geom. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02161">arXiv:1708.02161</a>)<br>
        
        We define a Weil-Petersson potential function on the space of Bridgeland stability conditions,
        with the hope of further understand the stringy K&auml;hler moduli space of Calabi-Yau manifolds.
        We show that the induced Weil-Petersson metric coincides with the Bergman metric in some two-dimensional cases.

        <h2>Categorical dynamical systems</h2>
        
        <h4>Entropy of an autoequivalence on Calabi-Yau manifolds</h4>
        Math. Res. Lett., 2018. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06957">arXiv:1704.06957</a>)<br>
        
        We construct the first counterexamples of a conjecture on categorical entropy by Kikuta and Takahashi.
        The result shows that because of the existence of `hidden symmetries' on Calabi-Yau manifolds
        (autoequivalences that are not generated by tensoring line bundles, automorphisms, and shiftings),
        the autoequivalences on the derived categories contain much richer dynamical information than the
        automorphisms on Calabi-Yau manifolds.
        
        <h4>On entropy of P-twists</h4>
        Submitted. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10485">arXiv:1801.10485</a>)<br>
        
        P-twists are the mirror of Dehn twists along Lagrangian complex projective space under mirror symmetry.
        We compute the categorical entropy of autoequivalences given by P-twists,
        and show that these autoequivalences satisfy a Gromov-Yomdin type conjecture.

        <b>New rational cubic fourfolds arising from Cremona transformations</b>
            (with Kuan-Wen Lai)<br>
        Submitted. [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00366" target="_blank">arXiv</a>]<br>
        <p style="margin-left:40px">
            Are Fourier-Mukai equivalent cubic fourfolds birationally equivalent?
            We obtain an affirmative answer to this question for very general cubic fourfolds of discriminant 20,
            where we produce birational maps via the Cremona transformation defined by the Veronese surface.
            Moreover, by studying how these maps act on the cubics known to be rational, we found new rational examples.

        <b>Mirror of Atiyah flop in symplectic geometry and stability conditions</b>
            (with Hansol Hong, Siu-Cheong Lau and Shing-Tung Yau)<br>
        Adv. Theor. Math. Phys., 2018. [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02942" target="_blank">arXiv</a>]<br>
        <p style="margin-left:40px">
        We study the mirror operation of the Atiyah flop in symplectic geometry.
        We formulate the operation for a symplectic manifold with a Lagrangian fibration.
        Furthermore we construct geometric stability conditions on the derived Fukaya category of the deformed conifold
        and study the action of the mirror Atiyah flop on these stability conditions.<br>

        <p style="margin-left:40px">
            Moduli spaces of points on n-spheres carry natural actions of braid groups.
            For n=0, 1, and 3, we prove that these symmetries extend to actions of mapping class groups of positive genus surfaces,
            through isomorphisms with certain moduli of local systems. This relies on the existence of group structure for spheres in these dimensions.
            We also use the connection to demonstrate that the space of rank 4 Stokes matrices with fixed Coxeter invariant of nonzero discriminant
            contains only finitely many integral braid group orbits.<br>

        <h3>Categorical dynamical systems</h3>
        
        <b>Asymptotic shifting numbers in triangulated categories</b>
            (with Simion Filip)<br>
        Submitted. [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06159" target="_blank">arXiv</a>]<br>
        <p style="margin-left:40px">
            We study invariants, called shifting numbers, that measure the asymptotic amount by which an autoequivalence of a triangulated category translates
            inside the category. The invariants are analogous to Poincar&eacute; translation numbers that are widely used in dynamical systems.
            We additionally establish that in some examples the shifting numbers provide a quasimorphism on the group of autoequivalences.
            Additionally, the shifting numbers are related to the entropy function introduced by Dimitrov, Haiden, Katzarkov, and Kontsevich,
            as well as the phase functions of Bridgeland stability conditions.

        <b>Categorical polynomial entropy</b>
            (with Lie Fu and Genki Ouchi)<br>
        Adv. Math., 2021. [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.14224" target="_blank">arXiv</a>]<br>
        <p style="margin-left:40px">
            For classical dynamical systems, the polynomial entropy serves as a refined invariant of the topological entropy.
            In the setting of categorical dynamical systems, i.e., triangulated categories endowed with an endofunctor,
            we develop the theory of categorical polynomial entropy, refining the categorical entropy defined by
            Dimitrov-Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich. We justify this notion by showing that for an automorphism of a smooth
            projective variety, the categorical polynomial entropy of the pullback functor on the derived category coincides
            with the polynomial growth rate of the induced action on cohomology. We also establish in general a Yomdin-type
            lower bound for the categorical polynomial entropy of an endofunctor in terms of the induced endomorphism on the
            numerical Grothendieck group of the category. As examples, we compute the categorical polynomial entropy for some
            standard functors like shifts, Serre functors, tensoring line bundles, automorphisms, spherical twists, P-twists,
            and so on, illustrating clearly how categorical polynomial entropy refines the study of categorical entropy and
            enables us to study the phenomenon of categorical trichotomy. A parallel theory of polynomial mass growth rate is
            developed in the presence of Bridgeland stability conditions.

        <b>On pseudo-Anosov autoequivalences</b>
            (with Simion Filip, Fabian Haiden, Ludmil Katzarkov, and Yijia Liu)<br>
        Adv. Math., 2021. [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12350" target="_blank">arXiv</a>]<br>
        <p style="margin-left:40px">
            Motivated by the connections between Teichm&uuml;ller theory and Bridgeland stability conditions,
            we prove that any autoequivalence of a triangulated category induces a filtration by triangulated subcategories,
            provided the existence of Bridgeland stability conditions. The filtration is given by the exponential growth rate
            of masses under iterates of the autoequivalence, and only depends on the choice of a connected component of the
            stability manifold. We then propose a new definition of pseudo-Anosov autoequivalences, and prove that our
            definition is more general than the one previously proposed by Dimitrov-Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich. We construct
            new examples of pseudo-Anosov autoequivalences on the derived categories of quintic Calabi-Yau threefolds and
            quiver Calabi-Yau categories. Finally, we prove that certain pseudo-Anosov autoequivalences on quiver 3-Calabi-Yau
            categories  act hyperbolically on the space of Bridgeland stability conditions.

        <b>Entropy of an autoequivalence on Calabi-Yau manifolds</b><br>
        Math. Res. Lett., 2018. [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06957" target="_blank">arXiv</a>]<br>
        <p style="margin-left:40px">
        We construct the first counterexamples of a conjecture on categorical entropy by Kikuta and Takahashi.
        The result shows that because of the existence of `hidden symmetries' on Calabi-Yau manifolds
        (autoequivalences that are not generated by tensoring line bundles, automorphisms, and shiftings),
        the autoequivalences on the derived categories contain much richer dynamical information than the
        automorphisms on Calabi-Yau manifolds.

        <b>On entropy of P-twists</b><br>
        Preprint. [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10485" target="_blank">arXiv</a>]<br>
        <p style="margin-left:40px">
        P-twists are the mirror of Dehn twists along Lagrangian complex projective space under mirror symmetry.
        We compute the categorical entropy of autoequivalences given by P-twists,
        and show that these autoequivalences satisfy a Gromov-Yomdin type conjecture.

        <b>Weil-Petersson geometry on the space of Bridgeland stability conditions</b>
            (with Atsushi Kanazawa and Shing-Tung Yau)<br>
        Comm. Anal. Geom., 2021. [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02161" target="_blank">arXiv</a>]<br>
        <p style="margin-left:40px">
            Inspired by mirror symmetry, we investigate some differential geometric aspects of the space of Bridgeland
            stability conditions on a Calabi-Yau triangulated category. The aim is to develop theory of Weil-Petersson
            geometry on the stringy K&auml;hler moduli space. A few basic examples are studied. In particular, we identify
            our Weil-Petersson metric with the Bergman metric on a Siegel modular variety in the case of the self-product
            of an elliptic curve.

        <b>Systolic inequalities for K3 surfaces via stability conditions</b><br>
        Accepted to Math. Z. [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09684" target="_blank">arXiv</a>]<br>
        <!--(<a href="http://scgp.stonybrook.edu/video_portal/video.php?id=3940">video</a>)-->
        <p style="margin-left:40px">
            We introduce the notions of categorical systoles and categorical volumes of Bridgeland stability conditions
            on triangulated categories. We prove a systolic inequality for any complex projective K3 surface,
            which is an algebro-geometric generalization of Loewner's torus systolic inequality.
            We also discuss applications of this inequality in symplectic geometry.

        <b>Contractibility of space of stability conditions on the projective plane via global dimension function</b>

        Submitted. [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11984" target="_blank">arXiv</a>]<br>
        <p style="margin-left:40px">
            We give an alternate proof of the contractibility of the principal component of the space of Bridgeland stability
            conditions on the derived category of projective plane by examine the global dimension function introduced by
            Ikeda-Qiu.
            Furthermore, we show that most of the stability conditions on local projective plane
            can be induced from stability conditions on projective plane by Ikeda-Qiu's inducing theorem.

        <b>On the geometric realization of stable objects in Calabi-Yau categories</b>

        In preparation. <br>
        <p style="margin-left:40px">
            We show that there is a foliation on the space of Bridgeland stability conditions on the
            3-Calabi-Yau category associated to A2-quiver, such that each leaf is the base of certain
            Lefschetz fibration, where stable objects correspond to special Lagrangian Lefschetz thimbles, and
            central charges are the integration of the holomorphic top form on the total space.

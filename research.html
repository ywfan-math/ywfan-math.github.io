        <b>Mirror of Atiyah flop in symplectic geometry and stability conditions

        Adv. Theor. Math. Phys., 2018. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02942">arXiv:1706.02942</a>)<br>

        We study the mirror operation of the Atiyah flop in symplectic geometry.
        We formulate the operation for a symplectic manifold with a Lagrangian fibration.
        Furthermore we construct geometric stability conditions on the derived Fukaya category of the deformed conifold
        and study the action of the mirror Atiyah flop on these stability conditions.<br>

        <b>On cubic fourfolds containing a Veronese surface
            (with Kuan-Wen Lai)</b><br>
        In preparation. <br>
        <p style="margin-left:40px">
            Huybrechts conjectured that if two cubic fourfolds have equivalent associated K3 categories
            (Kuznetsov components), then they are birational.
            Using the idea of Cremona transformations,
            we prove the conjecture when one of the cubic fourfolds contains a Veronese surface.

            We show that any autoequivalence on a triangulated category induces a canonical filtration of
            invariant thick triangulated subcategories.
            Then we give a new (more general) definition of pseudo-Anosov autoequivalences and provide
            several examples on 3-Calabi-Yau categories, including the derived categories of quintic threefolds.
            This work is motivated by the connections between Teichm&uuml;ller theory and Bridgeland stability conditions.

        We construct the first counterexamples of a conjecture on categorical entropy by Kikuta and Takahashi.
        The result shows that because of the existence of `hidden symmetries' on Calabi-Yau manifolds
        (autoequivalences that are not generated by tensoring line bundles, automorphisms, and shiftings),
        the autoequivalences on the derived categories contain much richer dynamical information than the
        automorphisms on Calabi-Yau manifolds.

        P-twists are the mirror of Dehn twists along Lagrangian complex projective space under mirror symmetry.
        We compute the categorical entropy of autoequivalences given by P-twists,
        and show that these autoequivalences satisfy a Gromov-Yomdin type conjecture.

            We show that there is a foliation on the space of Bridgeland stability conditions on the
            3-Calabi-Yau category associated to A2-quiver, such that each leaf is the base of certain
            Lefschetz fibration, where stable objects correspond to special Lagrangian Lefschetz thimbles, and
            central charges are the integration of the holomorphic top form on the total space.

        We define a Weil-Petersson potential function on the space of Bridgeland stability conditions,

        We propose a natural generalization of Loewner's torus systolic inequality from the perspective of Calabi-Yau geometry.
        We ask whether the square of the minimum volume of special Lagrangians in a Calabi-Yau manifold is bounded above
        by the total volume of the Calabi-Yau. We introduce the categorical analogues of systole and volume in terms of
        Bridgeland stability conditions, which enables us to formulate the mirror question under mirror symmetry.
        Finally, we give an affirmative answer to the mirror question for K3 surfaces of Picard rank one.

            We give an alternate proof of the contractibility of the space of Bridgeland stability conditions on
            the derived category of projective plane by examine the global dimension function introduced by Ikeda-Qiu.
            Furthermore, we show that any stability conditions on local projective plane is induced from some stability
            condition on projective plane by Ikeda-Qiu's inducing theorem.

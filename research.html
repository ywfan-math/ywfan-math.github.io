        <h4>Mirror of Atiyah flop in symplectic geometry and stability conditions
            (with Hansol Hong, Siu-Cheong Lau and Shing-Tung Yau)</h4>
        Adv. Theor. Math. Phys., 2018. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02942">arXiv:1706.02942</a>)<br>
        
        We study the mirror operation of the Atiyah flop in symplectic geometry.
        We formulate the operation for a symplectic manifold with a Lagrangian fibration.
        Furthermore we construct geometric stability conditions on the derived Fukaya category of the deformed conifold
        and study the action of the mirror Atiyah flop on these stability conditions.
        
        <h4>Weil-Petersson geometry on the space of Bridgeland stability conditions
            (with Atsushi Kanazawa and Shing-Tung Yau)</h4>
        Accepted to Comm. Anal. Geom. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02161">arXiv:1708.02161</a>)<br>
        
        We define a Weil-Petersson potential function on the space of Bridgeland stability conditions,
        with the hope of further understand the stringy K&auml;hler moduli space of Calabi-Yau manifolds.
        We show that the induced Weil-Petersson metric coincides with the Bergman metric in some two-dimensional cases.

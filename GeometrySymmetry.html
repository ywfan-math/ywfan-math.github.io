        <b>Course Description:</b>
        Group is a mathematical concept describing the symmetry of objects, and has a wide range of applications in modern science.
        This course introduces basic concepts and methods of groups through examples and geometric phenomena, and aims to gain an intuitive understanding of how to
        use the methods of groups to study symmetries. The course starts from the symmetries of common geometric objects in plane and solid geometry, introduces the
        definition and basic principles of groups, and applies them to descriptions such as symmetry groups of regular polyhedra, plane symmetry groups (wallpaper
        classification), Mobius transformation, and other related content and method.

        Homework is a crucial part of this class.
        Homework will be assigned weekly, and normally due Wednesday in class.

        <b>Collaboration:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the assignments. In your solutions, you should acknowledge the students with whom you worked,
        and you should write your solutions on your own. For any solution you submit, you should understand it well enough that you can explain it to someone else
        and answer questions about it. If you find yourself writing down things that you can’t explain, you should go back and think more about the problem.
        Otherwise you’re doing yourself a disservice, and you might suffer more when it comes time to take the exam.

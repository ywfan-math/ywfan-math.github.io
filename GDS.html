<b>Title:</b> Isoresidual fibration and resonance arrangements
<br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b> 
Meromorphic 1-forms on the Riemann sphere with prescribed orders of singularities form strata endowed with period coordinates. Fixing residues at the poles defines a fibration of any stratum to the vector space of configurations of residues. 
In a joint work with Quentin Gendron, it has been proved that for strata of 1-forms with only one zero, the isoresidual fibration is a cover of the space of configurations of residues ramified over an arrangement of complex hyperplanes called the resonance arrangement. Using combinatorics of decorated tree and the dictionary between complex analysis and flat geometry, we give a formula to compute the degree of this cover and investigate its monodromy.
In a more recent work with Dawei Chen, Quentin Gendron and Miguel Prado, we investigate the case of strata with two zeroes where isoresidual fibers are complex curves endowed with a canonical translation structure. Singularities of this structure provide topological invariants of the fibers that refine the Euler characteristic and still lack an interpretation in terms of enumerative geometry.

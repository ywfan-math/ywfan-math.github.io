        Welcome to the Online Seminar on Algebraic and Complex Dynamics.<br>
        <br>
        
        This is a new seminar, centered loosely around algebraic dynamics, complex dynamics, and related topics.
        We meet weekly for a 90-minute talk, with the first 30 minutes aiming towards non-experts and graduate students.
        After the talk we will have 30 minutes of informal discussion.<br>
        <br>
        
        The seminar usually takes place on Tuesdays, either at 3pm in Beijing/Taipei (= UTC 7am) or at 9am in Beijing/Taipei (= UTC 1am),
        depending on where the speakers are located.
        The talks will be hosted on Zoom. All are welcome to tune in.<br>
        <br>

        <b>Title:</b> An upper bound for polynomial log-volume growth of automorphisms of zero entropy<br>
        <br>
        <b>Abstract:</b>
        Let f by an automorphism of zero entropy of a smooth projective variety X. The polynomial log-volume growth plov(f) of f is a natural analog of Gromov's
            log-volume growth of automorphisms (of positive entropy), formally introduced by Cantat and Paris-Romaskevich for slow dynamics in 2020. A surprising
            fact noticed by Lin, Oguiso, and Zhang in 2021 is that this dynamical invariant plov(f) essentially coincides with the Gelfand–Kirillov dimension of 
            the twisted homogeneous coordinate ring associated with (X, f), introduced by Artin, Tate, and Van den Bergh in the 1990s. 
            It was conjectured by them that plov(f) is bounded above by d^2, where d = dim X. 
            
            <br><br>
            
            We prove an upper bound for plov(f) in terms of the dimension d of X and another fundamental invariant k of (X, f) (i.e., the degree growth rate 
            of iterates f^n with respect to an arbitrary ample divisor on X). As a corollary, we prove the above conjecture based on an earlier work of Dinh, 
            Lin, Oguiso, and Zhang. This is joint work with Chen Jiang.

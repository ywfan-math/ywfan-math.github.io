<h2><p style="color: rgb(0,150,0)">Description</p></h2>
Welcome to the Online Seminar on Algebraic and Complex Dynamics.
<br><br>
This seminar centered loosely around algebraic dynamics, complex dynamics, and related topics.
We meet weekly for a 90-minute talk, with the first 30 minutes aiming towards non-experts and graduate students.
After the talk we will have 30 minutes of informal discussion.
<br><br>
The seminar usually takes place on Tuesdays, either at 9am in Beijing/Taipei (= UTC 1am)  or at 3pm in Beijing/Taipei (= UTC 7am), 
depending on where the speakers are located. The talks will be hosted on Zoom. All are welcome to tune in.

<b>Title:</b> Some Developments on Filtration Methods  in Diophantine Geometry and Nevanlinna Theory
<br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b> In 1994 Faltings and W\"ustholz introduced a new geometric method in the study of Diophantine approximation, called the filtration method, which involved working with ``many" sections of a line bundle and producing many linear combinations of them vanishing along appropriate divisors.  This was further developed by Evertse and Ferretti.  Independently, Corvaja and Zannier also worked with filtrations of the same kind, which was  further refined and developed by Levin and Autissier, etc.  Recently, Ru and Vojta formulated a general version of the celebrated Schmidt's Subspace  Theorem that unifying many known results with filtration methods.   We will introduce these developments and  mention some applications of Ru-Vojta's theorem in the study of integral points and gcd theorem.  We will also mention some corresponding results in Nevanlinna theory.  This talk includes joint works with Erwan Rousseau and Amos Turchet and a joint work with Ji Guo and one with Yu Yasufuku.

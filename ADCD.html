        Welcome to the Online Seminar on Algebraic and Complex Dynamics.<br>
        <br>
        
        This is a new seminar, centered loosely around algebraic dynamics, complex dynamics, and related topics.
        We meet weekly for a 90-minute talk, with the first 30 minutes aiming towards non-experts and graduate students.
        After the talk we will have 30 minutes of informal discussion.<br>
        <br>
        
        The seminar usually takes place on Tuesdays, either at 3pm in Beijing/Taipei (= UTC 7am) or at 9am in Beijing/Taipei (= UTC 1am),
        depending on where the speakers are located.
        The talks will be hosted on Zoom. All are welcome to tune in.<br>
        <br>

        <b>Title:</b> Anosov representations, Hodge theory, and Lyapunov exponents<br>
        <br>
        <b>Abstract:</b>

Discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups arise in a variety of contexts, sometimes "in nature" as monodromy groups of families of algebraic manifolds, and other times in relation to geometric structures and associated dynamical systems. I will discuss a class of such discrete subgroups that arise from certain variations of Hodge structure and lead to Anosov representations, thus relating algebraic and dynamical situations. Among many consequences of these relations, I will explain Torelli theorems for certain families of Calabi-Yau manifolds (including the mirror quintic), uniformization results for domains of discontinuity of the associated discrete groups, and also a proof of a conjecture of Eskin, Kontsevich, Moller, and Zorich on Lyapunov exponents. The discrete groups of interest live inside the real linear symplectic group, and the domains of discontinuity are inside Lagrangian Grassmanians and other associated flag manifolds. The necessary context and background will be explained.

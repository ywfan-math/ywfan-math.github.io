<h2><p style="color: rgb(0,150,0)">Description</p></h2>
Welcome to the Online Seminar on Algebraic and Complex Dynamics.
<br><br>
This seminar centered loosely around algebraic dynamics, complex dynamics, and related topics.
We meet weekly for a 90-minute talk, with the first 30 minutes aiming towards non-experts and graduate students.
After the talk we will have 30 minutes of informal discussion.
<br><br>
The seminar usually takes place on Tuesdays, either at 9am in Beijing/Taipei (= UTC 1am)  or at 3pm in Beijing/Taipei (= UTC 7am), 
depending on where the speakers are located. The talks will be hosted on Zoom. All are welcome to tune in.

<b>Title:</b> Motivic DT invariants of quadratic differentials
<br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b> The problem of counting saddle connections and closed loops on Riemann surfaces with quadratic differential (equivalently: half-translation surfaces) can be, somewhat surprisingly, reformulated in terms of counting semistable objects in a 3-d Calabi-Yau category with stability condition. Here "counting" happens within the powerful framework of motivic Donaldson-Thomas theory as developed by Kontsevich-Soibelman, Joyce, and others. For meromorphic quadratic differentials with simple zeros, this reformulation is due to the work of Bridgeland-Smith. The case of quadratic differentials without higher order poles - in particular holomorphic ones - requires entirely different methods, based on deformation of A-infinity categories and transfer of stability conditions. As an application, counts of saddle connections and closed loops are related by the wall-crossing formula as one moves around in the moduli space. Based on 2104.06018 and 2303.18249.

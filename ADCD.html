        Welcome to the Online Seminar in Algebraic and Complex Dynamics.<br>
        <br>
        
        This is a new seminar, centered loosely around algebraic dynamics, complex dynamics, and related topics.
        We meet weekly for a 90 minutes talk, with the first 30 minutes aiming towards non-experts and graduate students.
        After the talk we will have 30 minutes of informal discussion.<br>
        <br>
        
        The seminar usually takes place on Tuesdays at 3pm in Beijing/Taipei (= UTC 7am), or possibly at 9am in Beijing/Taipei (= UTC 1am),
        depending on where the speakers are located.
        The talks will be hosted on Zoom. All are welcome to tune in.<br>
        <br>

        <b>Title:</b> b-divisors and dynamical degrees<br>
        <br>
        <b>Abstract:</b>
        Joint work with Nguyen Bac Dang.
        We develop an intersection theory for b-divisors and used it to get informations on the degree growth of iterates of rational maps.

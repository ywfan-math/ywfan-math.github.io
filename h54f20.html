                (10/18) Thanks Ujjwal for the question today!
                To define the angle between two vectors v_1 and v_2 in an arbitrary inner product space,
                we have to first prove Problem 7 in HW6, which states that |(v_1,v_2)| is not larger than ||v_1||*||v_2||,
                then we can define the angle to be arccos of the ratio |(v_1,v_2)|/(||v_1||*||v_2||).
            </li>
            <li>
                (10/18) HW7 is posted below.

                (10/17)
                Because of a schedule conflict, Yu-Wei has to move his office hours on Thursdays to <b>Fridays 12-1:30pm PDT</b> for the rest of the semester.
                Sorry about this!

            <li>
                (10/15)
                Every vector space has an inner product. Proof sketch: Choose a basis of the vector space (which exists by the axiom of choice).
                Define the inner product by letting the self-inner product of any basis vector to be 1, and inner product of any pair of basis vectors
                to be 0. Then extend the inner product by bi-linearity.
            </li>
            <li>
                (10/14)
                Update on HW6: a problem (#10) has been added.
            </li>
            <li>
                (10/2)
                HW5 is posted below.
                The extra credit problems can be done using what we've learned so far.
                They'll be used if we discuss the generalized eigenspace decomposition.

                (9/24) Thanks for the questions today! Actually,
                "every vector space has a basis" is equivalent to the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice" target="_blank">axiom of choice</a>,
                so it definitely is not an obvious statement!
                See
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra)#Proof_that_every_vector_space_has_a_basis" target="_blank">here</a>
                for a proof.

            <li>
                (9/4)
                There is a "late due date" for each homework assignment which you may see on Gradescope:
                that indicates the due date of some DSP students who have discussed with me about the appropiate length of extension.
                <b>For other students, the due date of your homework is still on Tuesday at 8am.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                (9/4) Some ground rules on exams and quizzes:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        They'll be open-book/note, but you're only allowed to use the textbook, notes from the lectures,
                        or things that can be found on the course website (e.g. homework solutions, which will be posted later on).
                        In particular, you are NOT allowed to receive/give any assistance in any form during the exam.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        About which theorems/statements you can use without proof in the exams/quizzes:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                First of all, if you're using a theorem/statement without giving a proof,
                                you should write down the name of the theorem or the precise statement before using it.
                                (This applies to any mathematical writing, not just on our exams/quizzes.)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                For <b>quizzes</b>: For Quiz N+1, you can use any statement that is proved in the lectures,
                                or any statement that appears in HW 1,... ,HW N. (N is a positive integer.)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                For <b>exams</b>: You can use any statement that is proved in the lectures,
                                or any statement that appears in homework assignments.
                            </li>

        <h3>Course Information</h3>
        
        Honors version of Math 54. The course has two parts:
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Part I: Linear algebra.</b> Basic linear algebra; matrix arithmetic and determinants;
                vector spaces and inner product spaces; eigenvalues and eigenvectors; linear transformations.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <b>Part II: Differential equations.</b> Homogeneous ordinary differential equations;
                first-order differential equations with constant coefficients; Fourier series and partial
                differential equations.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <b>Honors Course:</b> This course is aimed at students with a strong ability and interest in mathematics.
        I will follow the curriculum for Math 54 but will try to provide greater rigor (real proofs),
        greater insight, and more interesting exercises. I don't expect the grading scale to be either higher or
        lower than for regular Math 54, but you will have to do more thinking to get a good grade; I hope that
        you will enjoy this. If you start H54 but find in a few weeks that it is not the course for you, it should
        be possible to transfer to regular Math 54 and not be at a disadvantage.
        <br>

<!--        
        <b>Warning:</b> The goal of this class is to have students learn the subject well and then to give them fair
        and accurate grades. To achieve this goal, the instructor believes in
        <b>hard homework problems</b> and <b>hard exams</b>.
        Hard problems make students learn more and better, and hard exams give a better evaluation of students' learning.
        In other words, if you are taking this class just to get a grade and with no intention to learn,
        consider taking another class/section.
        <br><br>
-->

        <b>Grading:</b> Homework 10%, Quizzes 10%, First Midterm 20%, Second Midterm 20%, Final 40%.<br>
        <b>There will be no makeup exams and quizzes.</b>
        However, the lowest score of the two midterms will be replaced by the final exam score if this increases your total score. So you can miss one midterm
        without too much damage. On the other hand, missing both midterms or missing the final will seriously harm your grade.
        <b>Please check the dates now (see below) to make sure that you have no unavoidable conflicts!</b>
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Incomplete grade:</b> According to university policy, a grade of Incomplete (I) can be assigned only if the student's work has been of passing quality
        but is incomplete due to circumstances beyond the student's control. Therefore, one will not be assigned an Incomplete grade if the average of one's
        midterm scores does not exceed 60. This is a strict policy and no exceptions will be made.

                Homework will be assigned weekly, and normally due on Tuesday before class.
            </li>
            <li>
                Homework will be posted below at least 7 days prior to the due date. You'll see this in the Announcement once it's posted.
            </li>
            <li>
                Homework has to be submitted via <b>Gradescope</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The submission should be a <b>single PDF file</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make sure the writing in your submission is clear enough to the reader!
            </li>
            <li>
                Occasionally there will be extra credit problems, which you'll need to submit separately.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <b>Grading policy:</b> A few selected problems will be graded carefully, and around 2-3 (out of 10) points will be based on the completion.<br>
        The lowest homework grade will be dropped.
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Late homework policy:</b> As a rule late homework will not be accepted under any circumstances. If you have a medical circumstance that prevents you
        from turning in homework, you will need a doctor's note to receive an extension. Furthermore, a note that merely says “Student visited today” is not very
        helpful; it’s better to have a note that says something like “Student may be unable to complete assignments for the next N days.” This will help me decide

        <b>Collaboration:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the assignments. In your solutions, you should acknowledge the students with whom you worked,
        and you should write your solutions on your own. For any solution you submit, you should understand it well enough that you can explain it to someone else
        and answer questions about it. If you find yourself writing down things that you can’t explain, you should go back and think more about the problem.
        Otherwise you’re doing yourself a disservice, and you might suffer more when it comes time to take the exam.

        <h3>Quizzes</h3>
        
        Quizzes will be given on most Mondays via <b>Gradescope</b>. To accommodate people in different time zones (even continents),
        the quizzes will be posted on Gradescope on Sunday noon, and be closed on Monday noon (PDT).
        Once you click on "Start Assignment", you'll have to finish the quiz within the "maximum time permitted" (usually around 30-40 minutes).
        <br><br>
        
        <b>When there is a quiz, the discussion section on the same day will not be held.</b>
        <br><br>
<!--        
        <ul>
            <li>
                Quizzes will be given on most Mondays, at 11:10-11:40am.
            </li>
            <li>
                Quizzes will be held on <b>Gradescope</b>. The anticipated time for finishing each quiz is about 20 minutes.
                The extra 10 minutes is to make sure that you will have enough time to scan/photocopy and upload your answers to Gradescope.
            </li>
            <li>
                When there is a quiz, the discussion section on that Monday will be held at 11:40am-noon.
                Otherwise, it'll be at 11:10am-noon as usual.
            </li>
        </ul>
-->
        
        There will be no makeup quizzes, but the lowest quiz score will be dropped.
        One purpose of the quizzes is to help make sure that you keep up with the material.
        Later parts of the course depend heavily on the earlier parts, so it can be hard to catch up if you fall behind.

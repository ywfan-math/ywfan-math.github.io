        <b>Notes on Zoom meeting:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You'll need to sign in to a Zoom account in order to enter the meeting.
                Berkeley provides free licensed Zoom accounts for all students, see
                <a href="https://studenttech.berkeley.edu/zoom" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                You're strongly encouraged to ask/answer questions anytime during the lecture.
                You can either open your audio and speak, or type in the chat.
                There also is a "raise hand" feature on Zoom that you can use.
            </li>
            <li>
                You're strongly encouraged to have your video open, so that we could be "face to face".
            </li>
            <li>
                On the other hand, when you're not speaking to the whole class, please have your audio muted.
            </li>

        <h3>Course Information</h3>
        
        <b>Topics:</b> The real number system. Sequences, limits, and continuous functions in R.
        The concept of a metric space. Uniform convergence, interchange of limit operations. Infinite series.
        Mean value theorem and applications. The Riemann integral.
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Grading:</b> Homework 30%, First Midterm 20%, Second Midterm 20%, Final 30%. <br>
        <b>There will be no makeup exams under any circumstances.</b>
        However, the lowest score of the two midterms will be replaced by the final exam score if this increases your total score.
        So you can miss one midterm without too much damage.
        On the other hand, missing both midterms or missing the final will seriously harm your grade.
        <b>Please check the exam dates now (see below) to make sure that you have no unavoidable conflicts!</b>
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Incomplete Grade:</b>
        According to university policy, a grade of Incomplete (I) can be assigned only if the student's work has been of passing quality
        but is incomplete due to circumstances beyond the student's control.
        Therefore, one will not be assigned an Incomplete grade if the average of one's midterm scores does not exceed 60.
        This is a strict policy and no exceptions will be made.

            <li><b>Textbook:</b> Ross, <i>Elementary Analysis: The Theory of Calculus</i> (Second Edition).
                You can download a copy of this book

        <h3>Homework</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                Homework will be assigned weekly, and normally due on Tuesday before class.
            </li>
            <li>
                Homework will be posted below at least 7 days prior to the due date. You'll see this in the Announcement once it's posted.
            </li>
            <li>
                Homework has to be submitted via <b>Gradescope</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The submission should be a <b>single PDF file</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make sure the writing in your submission is clear enough to the reader!
            </li>
        </ul>

        <b>Grading policy:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A few selected problems will be graded carefully, and around 2-3 (out of 10) points will be based on the completion.
            </li>
            <li>
                The lowest homework grade will be dropped.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <b>Late homework policy:</b> As a rule late homework will not be accepted under any circumstances. If you have a medical circumstance that prevents you
        from turning in homework, you will need a doctor's note to receive an extension. Furthermore, a note that merely says “Student visited today” is not very
        helpful; it’s better to have a note that says something like “Student may be unable to complete assignments for the next N days.” This will help me decide
        what length of extension is appropriate.
        <br><br>
        
<!--        
        <b>Collaboration:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the assignments. In your solutions, you should acknowledge the students with whom you worked,
        and you should write your solutions on your own. For any solution you submit, you should understand it well enough that you can explain it to someone else
        and answer questions about it. If you find yourself writing down things that you can’t explain, you should go back and think more about the problem.
        Otherwise you’re doing yourself a disservice, and you might suffer more when it comes time to take the exam.

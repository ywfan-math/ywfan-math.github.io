                (4/15) HW11 is posted below.
            </li>
            <li>
                (4/7) Second midterm:
                <a href="https://ywfan-math.github.io/104s21_midterm2_sol.pdf" target="_blank">solution</a> and 
                <a href="https://ywfan-math.github.io/104s21_midterm2_stat.pdf" target="_blank">grade distribution</a>

                (3/17) About the second midterm:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Same ground rules as the first midterm; see the announcement on 2/12 below.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It's a <b>90 minutes</b> exam. (The exam is designed so that you're expected to finish within 80 minutes,
                        and you have extra 10 minutes to upload your answers on Gradescope.)
                        <b>Late submissions will not be accepted</b>, so make sure that you save enough time to upload your answers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The exam will be opened on Gradescope on <b>March 31, 1pm PT</b>, and will be closed on <b>April 1, 1pm PT</b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The exam will cover everything we discuss before the spring break, but mostly focusing on material after the first midterm.

                (2/13) What to expect in the first midterm:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Problem 1: (15 points) You'll be asked to prove the convergence of certain sequence <b>based on the definition</b>.
                        You're not allowed to use any theorem for this problem.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Problem 2 and Problem 3 (20 points each): You'll be asked to prove certain statements.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Problem 4: (9 points each) You'll see five independent statements (a)(b)(c)(d)(e) in this problem,
                        and you'll be asked to determine whether each of them is true or false.
                        You have to prove the statement if you think the statement is true; otherwise,
                        you have to provide an explicit counterexample and justify that it is indeed a counterexample.
                        <b>Answers without justification (or justification that does not make sense) will not be given credits</b>.

                (2/12) Some ground rules on exams:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Exams are open-book; but you're only allowed to use the textbook, notes from the lectures,
                        or things that can be found on the course website (e.g. homework solutions, which will be posted later on).
                        In particular, you are NOT allowed to receive/give any assistance in any form during the exam.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can use any statement that is proved in the lectures, or any statement that appears in homework assignments.
                        If you’d like to use other results, you have to prove them before using them.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The exam will cover everything we discussed so far, except the material covered in the last 3 pages of the notes from Lecture 8
                        (the equivalence between compact and sequentially compact).

                (1/18) There is a "late due date" for each homework assignment which you may see on Gradescope:
                that indicates the due date of some DSP students who have discussed with me about the appropiate length of extension.
                <b>For other students, the due date of your homework is still on Tuesday at 11am.</b>
            </li>
            <li>

        <h3>Course Information</h3>
        
        <b>Topics:</b> The real number system. Sequences, limits, and continuous functions in R.
        The concept of a metric space. Uniform convergence, interchange of limit operations. Infinite series.
        Mean value theorem and applications. The Riemann integral.
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Grading:</b> Homework 30%, First Midterm 20%, Second Midterm 20%, Final 30%. <br>
        <b>There will be no makeup exams under any circumstances.</b>
        However, the lowest score of the two midterms will be replaced by the final exam score if this increases your total score.
        So you can miss one midterm without too much damage.
        On the other hand, missing both midterms or missing the final will seriously harm your grade.
        <b>Please check the exam dates now (see below) to make sure that you have no unavoidable conflicts!</b>
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Incomplete Grade:</b>
        According to university policy, a grade of Incomplete (I) can be assigned only if the student's work has been of passing quality
        but is incomplete due to circumstances beyond the student's control.
        Therefore, one will not be assigned an Incomplete grade if the average of one's midterm scores does not exceed 60.
        This is a strict policy and no exceptions will be made.

        <h3>Homework</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                Homework will be assigned weekly, and normally due on Tuesday before class.
            </li>
            <li>
                Homework will be posted below at least 7 days prior to the due date. You'll see this in the Announcement once it's posted.
            </li>
            <li>
                Homework has to be submitted via <b>Gradescope</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The submission should be a <b>single PDF file</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make sure the writing in your submission is clear enough to the reader!
            </li>
        </ul>

        <b>Grading policy:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A few selected problems will be graded carefully, and around 2-3 (out of 10) points will be based on the completion.
            </li>
            <li>
                The lowest homework grade will be dropped.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <b>Late homework policy:</b> As a rule late homework will not be accepted under any circumstances. If you have a medical circumstance that prevents you
        from turning in homework, you will need a doctor's note to receive an extension. Furthermore, a note that merely says “Student visited today” is not very
        helpful; it’s better to have a note that says something like “Student may be unable to complete assignments for the next N days.” This will help me decide
        what length of extension is appropriate.
        <br><br>
        
<!--        
        <b>Collaboration:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the assignments. In your solutions, you should acknowledge the students with whom you worked,
        and you should write your solutions on your own. For any solution you submit, you should understand it well enough that you can explain it to someone else
        and answer questions about it. If you find yourself writing down things that you can’t explain, you should go back and think more about the problem.
        Otherwise you’re doing yourself a disservice, and you might suffer more when it comes time to take the exam.

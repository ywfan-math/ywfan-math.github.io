            <p>I'm David, a PhD Student in machine learning at TTIC, advised by 
            Karen Livescu.
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <p> I'm broadly interested in multimodal learning and issues of sample 
            complexity and efficiency in current deep learning models.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Before that, I graduated from the University of Chicago with a BS 
            in Mathematics and a BS in Molecular Engineering. During that time, 
            I spent a few years working with Matt Walter at TTIC.</p>
            <br>

            <p>As of September 2019, I'm supported by an NSF Graduate Research 
            Fellowship. </p>

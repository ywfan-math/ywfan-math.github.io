<p>I'm David, 
</p>
<br>
            
<p> I am an assistant professor at the Yau Mathematical Sciences Center at Tsinghua University in Beijing. 
I was previously at UC Berkeley as a Morrey visiting assistant professor, and did my PhD with Professor Shing-Tung Yau at Harvard.</p>
<br>

<p>My research interest lies broadly in algebraic geometry, dynamical systems, symplectic geometry, and mathematical physics. 
I am particularly interested in derived categories, mirror symmetry, stability conditions, and categorical dynamical systems.</p>

                (3/2) Due to the recent developments regarding coronavirus,
                I'll try to upload my lecture notes after class (warning: usually not in full detail!
                but at least you'll have an idea of what's covered),
                and you can submit homework via email (as a <b>pdf file</b>) to me
                <b>before Thursday 8am</b>.
                Homework submit via email after Thursday 8am will not be accepted under any circumstances.

        <h3>Course Information</h3>
        
        <b>Topics:</b> The real number system. Sequences, limits, and continuous functions in R.
        The concept of a metric space. Uniform convergence, interchange of limit operations. Infinite series.
        Mean value theorem and applications. The Riemann integral.
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Grading:</b> Homework 20%, First Midterm 20%, Second Midterm 20%, Final 40%.<br>
        <b>There will be no makeup exams under any circumstances.</b> However,
        the lowest score of the two midterms will be replaced by the final exam score if this increases
        your total score. So you can miss one midterm without too much damage.
        On the other hand, missing both midterms or missing the final will seriously harm your grade.
        <b>Please check the exam dates now to make sure that you have no unavoidable conflicts!</b>
        (Check the final exam schedule
        <a href="https://registrar.berkeley.edu/scheduling/academic-scheduling/final-exam-guide-schedules">here</a>.)
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Incomplete Grade:</b>
        According to university policy, a grade of Incomplete (I) can be assigned only if the student's work 
        has been of passing quality
        but is incomplete due to circumstances beyond the student's control.
        Therefore, one will not be assigned an Incomplete grade if the average of one's midterm scores does not exceed 60.
        This is a strict policy and no exceptions will be made.
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Warning:</b>
        The goal of this class is to have students learn the subject well and then to give them fair and accurate grades.
        To achieve this goal, the instructor believes in serious homework problems and hard exams.
        Serious problems make students learn more and better.
        Hard exams give a better evaluation of students' learning.
        In other words, if you are taking this class just to get a grade and with no intention to learn,
        consider taking another class/section.

        <h3>Homework</h3>
        
        Homework consists of reading and problems sets. There will be reading assigned for each lecture.
        You should come to the class having read the assigned sections of the textbook.
        <br>
        
        Problem sets will be assigned weekly. Assignments will be posted no later than midnight on Thursday
        and will be due at the beginning of the class on the following Thursday.
        You have to staple your work if it is more than a page.
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Grading policy:</b> a few selected problems will be graded carefully,
        and around 2-3 (out of 10) points will be based on the completion.<br>
        The lowest homework grade will be dropped.
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Late homework policy:</b> As a rule late homework will not be accepted under any circumstances.
        If you are late to class on Thursday, your homework is late and and will not be graded.
        If you have a medical circumstance
        that prevents you from turning in homework, you will need a doctor's note to receive an extension. Furthermore,
        a note that merely says “Student visited today” is not very helpful; it’s better to have a note that says something
        like “Student may be unable to complete assignments for the next N days.” This will help me decide what length of
        extension is appropriate.
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Collaboration:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the assignments. In your solutions, you should
        acknowledge the students with whom you worked, and you should write your solutions on your own. For any solution
        you submit, you should understand it well enough that you can explain it to someone else and answer questions
        about it. If you find yourself writing down things that you can’t explain, you should go back and think more about
        the problem. Otherwise you’re doing yourself a disservice, and you might suffer more when it comes time to take
        the midterms/exam.

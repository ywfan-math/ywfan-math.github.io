        <h3>Course Information</h3>
        
        Honors version of Math 54. The course has two parts:
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Part I: Linear algebra.</b> Basic linear algebra; matrix arithmetic and determinants;
                vector spaces and inner product spaces; eigenvalues and eigenvectors; linear transformations.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <b>Part II: Differential equations.</b> Homogeneous ordinary differential equations;
                first-order differential equations with constant coefficients; Fourier series and partial
                differential equations.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <b>Honors Course:</b> This course is aimed at students with a strong ability and interest in mathematics.
        I will follow the curriculum for Math 54 but will try to provide greater rigor (real proofs),
        greater insight, and more interesting exercises. I don't expect the grading scale to be either higher or
        lower than for regular Math 54, but you will have to do more thinking to get a good grade; I hope that
        you will enjoy this. If you start H54 but find in a few weeks that it is not the course for you, it should
        be possible to transfer to regular Math 54 and not be at a disadvantage.
        <br>
        
        For more information on honors courses in the math department, see the department's web page on
        <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/courses/choosing/honors-courses">honors courses</a>.
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Grading:</b> Homework 10%, Quizzes 10%, First Midterm 20%, Second Midterm 20%, Final 40%.<br>
        <b>There will be no makeup exams.</b>
        However, the lowest score of the two midterms will be replaced by the final exam score if this increases
        your total score. So you can miss one midterm without too much damage. On the other hand, missing both midterms
        or missing the final will seriously harm your grade.
        <b>Please check the dates now to make sure that you have no
            unavoidable conflicts!</b>

        <h3>Homework</h3>
        
        Homework will be assigned weekly. Assignments will be posted no later than midnight on Tuesday
        and will be due in discussion on the following Wednesday.
        You have to staple your work if it is more than a page.
        Homework will be graded based on completion.
        The lowest homework grade will be dropped.
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Late homework policy:</b> As a rule late homework will not be accepted under any circumstances. If you have a medical circumstance
        that prevents you from turning in homework, you will need a doctor's note to receive an extension. Furthermore,
        a note that merely says “Student visited today” is not very helpful; it’s better to have a note that says something
        like “Student may be unable to complete assignments for the next N days.” This will help me decide what length of
        extension is appropriate.
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Collaboration:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the assignments. In your solutions, you should
        acknowledge the students with whom you worked, and you should write your solutions on your own. For any solution
        you submit, you should understand it well enough that you can explain it to someone else and answer questions
        about it. If you find yourself writing down things that you can’t explain, you should go back and think more about
        the problem. Otherwise you’re doing yourself a disservice, and you might suffer more when it comes time to take
        the midterms/exam.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Quizzes</h3>
        
        Quizzes will be given on most Fridays in discussion section.
        There will be no makeup quizzes, but the lowest quiz score will be dropped.
        One purpose of the quizzes is to help make sure that you keep up with the material.
        Later parts of the course depend heavily on the earlier parts, so it can be hard to catch up if you fall behind.

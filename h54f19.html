                In particular, you must speak to the instructor before the end of the second week of classes.

        <h3>Course Information</h3>
        
        Honors version of Math 54. The course has two parts:
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Part I: Linear algebra.</b> Basic linear algebra; matrix arithmetic and determinants;
                vector spaces and inner product spaces; eigenvalues and eigenvectors; linear transformations.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <b>Part II: Differential equations.</b> Homogeneous ordinary differential equations;
                first-order differential equations with constant coefficients; Fourier series and partial
                differential equations.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <b>Honors Course:</b> This course is aimed at students with a strong ability and interest in mathematics.
        I will follow the curriculum for Math 54 but will try to provide greater rigor (real proofs),
        greater insight, and more interesting exercises. I don't expect the grading scale to be either higher or
        lower than for regular Math 54, but you will have to do more thinking to get a good grade; I hope that
        you will enjoy this. If you start H54 but find in a few weeks that it is not the course for you, it should
        be possible to transfer to regular Math 54 and not be at a disadvantage.

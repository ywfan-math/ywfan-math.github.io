        Categorical dynamical systems have fruitful connections with various mathematical fields, for instance with algebraic geometry,
      Teichmuller theory, symplectic geometry, and dynamical systems. The goal of this course is to give an introduction to the recent works on
      categorical dynamical systems. We will discuss the following topics which are closely related to the development of categorical dynamical systems:
      topological entropy, triangulated categories, categorical entropy, Bridgeland stability conditions, and mirror symmetry.

                (4/2) Just a reminder that there will be no class next Tuesday (4/5).
            </li>
            <li>
                (3/25) We'll be meeting online due to certain restrictions and health precautions.
                <b>Zoom Meeting ID: 984 962 1397</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                (2/25) According to your preference, we'll plan to spend more time on discussing stability conditions and mirror symmetry.
                Other topics that we mentioned in the first meeting (like topological entropy, Teichmuller theory, holomorphic dynamics) will also be discussed at some point,
                but they won't be discussed in-depth, and will mostly serve as motivations for our purpose.
                I hope this will help you decide whether you'd like to continue attending the meetings.

            <li>
                (2/22) In the following weeks, we'll merge the two scheduled breaks (20 minutes in total) between 1:30pm and 4:05pm into one 10-minutes break
                (just like what we did today), and end the meetings 10 minutes earlier (roughly 3:55pm).

              Please send me an email (yuwei<!-- -->fanx {at} gm<!-- -->ail.com) after the first meeting if you're planning to attend regularly, 
              so that I can add you into the mailing list.
              Important announcements (e.g. "there will be no lecture tomorrow due to certain accident or medical situation") will be sent to this mailing list.
              It'd be great if you could include the following information in the email, which will help me decide the topics to be discussed:

        <b>Lecture:</b> Tuesday 1:30-4pm, at <s>Jinchunyuan West Building Conference Room 3</s> <FONT color="#ff0000"><b>Zoom: 984 962 1397</b></FONT>

        <b>Topic:</b> Categorical dynamical systems have fruitful connections with various mathematical fields, for instance with algebraic geometry,
      Teichmuller theory, symplectic geometry, and dynamical systems. The goal of this course is to give an introduction to the recent works on
      categorical dynamical systems. We will discuss topics that are closely related to the development of categorical dynamical systems, including:
      topological entropy, triangulated categories, categorical entropy, Bridgeland stability conditions, and mirror symmetry.
      <br><br>
        
        <b>Prerequisites:</b> Basic category theory and algebraic geometry will be helpful.

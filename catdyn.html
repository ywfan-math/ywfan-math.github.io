        <h3>Course Information</h3>
        
        <b>Lecture:</b> Tuesday 1:30-4pm, at Jinchunyuan West Building Conference Room 3
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Instructor:</b> Yu-Wei Fan
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Topic:</b> Categorical dynamical systems have fruitful connections with various mathematical fields, for instance with algebraic geometry,
      Teichmuller theory, symplectic geometry, and dynamical systems. The goal of this course is to give an introduction to the recent works on
      categorical dynamical systems. We will discuss topics that are closely related to the development of categorical dynamical systems, including:
      topological entropy, triangulated categories, categorical entropy, Bridgeland stability conditions, and mirror symmetry.
      <br><br>
        
        <b>Prerequisites:</b> Basic category theory and algebraic geometry will be helpful.

        <h3>Presentations</h3>
        You're more than welcomed to give presentations in class!
        You can talk about your own research, or other papers that you find interesting and want to share with us.
        The topic does <b>not</b> have to be directly related to categorical dynamics.
        For instance, here are some papers that I found interesting personally and would like to hear more about:
